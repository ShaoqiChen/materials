## For topics of posts
buyi_post_topics.py can select the desired posts and obtain the general information about the posts, like what the post is about, when the post is created, who postted it, and so on.

All information about each post is saved in a row in Posts_22.csv file. 

Schema:

```
'Topic' :           str
'PostID':           str
'Author':           str
'AuthorID':         str
'Topic':            str
'PostID':           str 
'Author':           str
'AuthorID':         str
'Reply':            int 
'Click':            int 
'LastUpdate_date':  str
'LastUpdate_time':  str
'Follower':         str
'FollowerID':       str
```

## For contents of posts

In buyi_post_content.py, url for each post is generated by reading "PostID" in Posts_22.csv. The url is later used to get all content from post page which is saved into a scv file. After running script, 22 csv files containing 22 posts are saved in Posts_22 folder.

Each csv file contains the content postted by author and content postted by followers. At the same time, author and followers' IDs are displayed. Some content is not postted by text, but an image which is not included so far.

Schema:

```
'AuthorID':     str 
'Author':       str
'Reply_date':   str
'Reply_time':   str
'Text':         str
```
